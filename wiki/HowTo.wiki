#summary How to use django_dms

= Using the framework =
`django-dms` can be used as a framework, that is, to help developers build apps with document management features. It does this by defining an abstract data model (`DocumentBase`), which can be inherited and extended.

== Basic use ==
In your `models.py`, simply create a model from either `DocumentBase` or `BasicDocumentBase`.
{{{
from django_dms import DocumentBase

class Report(DocumentBase):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=150)
}}}

`BasicDocumentBase` already defines a few useful fields, such as `title`, `summary`, `author` and `date_created`. This can automatically be populated from the document's metadata, if the metadata system is connected (see below).
